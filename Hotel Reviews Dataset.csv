30,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,"The Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi/Saket has everything you need for a hotel with prime location in Delhi. The rooms were clean, the staff was super nice and I can never complain about a complimentary breakfast. The only thing that caught us off guard a little bit is that there is no direct entrance to the mall through the hotel. You have to walk outside and around the building for about a minute or so to get to the entrance of the mall. Other than that I highly recommend staying at the Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi/Saket. You won't be disappointed."
31,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,"Very good place to live. Rooms are very cozy and place is clean. Room service is fast and staffs are very nice, friendly and experienced. Last minute needs and services are always welcomed by them. Location is perfect, easy to find and located near malls like select City walk. Atmosphere and environment is very friendly and positive ."
32,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,"We used to stay several times at this hotel and we were extremely happy with everything, the staff, food at breakfast, service, cleanliness and room service. But in the recent year something has changed to worse. The food at breakfast offers poorer choice, all the familiar faces of staff have gone, room service is not as it used to be, now they changing bedding every other day and not every day. The sheets are not as clean as they used to be. The plates at the restaurant are not clean too. I have suspicion that they may changed the management and the new management is trying to economises on everything in order to show to their bosses that they can manage with less budget. They are trying to manage 5* hotel with 3* budget. We now thinking to stay at our next trip at the neighbouring hotel. It’s a shame because we loved how it used to be at Hilton. It was our best place!"
33,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,The hotel was located in the city. The shopping mall was nearby the hotel. The hotel location was crowded. All amenities were working properly in the room. The check in and check out was done on time. The buffet system in food was arranged but I had order in the room. I use activities in the hotel. I had booked the room on the spot.
34,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,I had more expectations from a Hilton Hotel. The stay wasn't great. The rooms were not worth the money that they charge for the hotel. The location is great though. Very easily accessible and has a lot of mall nearby to shop and eat as well. But I wouldn't recommend this hotel because you can definitely get a better hotel with these rates.
35,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,"I visited there and the food quality was the main point of attraction. I was delighted after seeing the food served by the waiter. Overall 9. 5/10. The most tasty thing was cheese chilly to me. I think it was one of the tastiest of all Delhian. In my notion when one comes to Delhi he must visit this hotel at least once. About hotel rooms, staff helped us a lot, he gave us all the basic requirements like shampoo, soap all these basic things."
36,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,"The hotel is at a fair location, good thing is that wifi has good speed and has got good strength. Hotel staff is very polite and always ready to help. They provide cab service to all parts in Delhi but it is a bit expensive. Overall I enjoyed my stay."
37,Hilton Garden Inn New Delhi Saket,The best hotel to have a lovely service with delicious foods and a very good hospitality and the list goes on. I stayed here many times where the ambience was too good. Lovely clean rooms which comforts us well. Great place for business travellers. Waiting for another stay in this hotel.
38,Trend GRD Inn Kalkaji,"I used to travel a lot in my occupation meanwhile, I used to stay in different hotel all along the Country. Generally, I travel alone and some time with my wife and always prefer safety and security as priority. In my opinion this hotel get full marks for their hospitality. Good interior and exterior.

Terrible experience"
46,Trend GRD Inn Kalkaji,The view around the hotel is good. The room service of hotel and their hospitality is good. Location of the hotel is at a good place that we can easily find it and also near metro station. If you are came to delhi then you can book that hotel.

63,Conclave Comfort East Of Kailash,"It's a very basic hotel. Room size is decent. Bed and other furniture was practical and comfortable. However bathrooms were very dated"", old looking. Bath fittings and fixtures looked dirty and old. Moreover there were cockroaches in the the bathroom. We stayed here at 46 degree Celcius temperature, but thankfully they had power backup and AC was working. Pricing was very attractive. Located in a decent area closer to Greater Kailash. We paid 3.5k for 2 rooms, which is a steal for Delhi"
64,Conclave Comfort East Of Kailash,"1) cockroaches in the room 2) limited drinking water provided 3) AC leaks water - a lot of water. Enough to make one side of the bed damp 4) I was refused a check-in as they wanted me to pay advance (it was firm sponsored) So, yes. Their rating is so low for a reason.

125,Trend Excellent,Everything was good. affordable and clean. for me as my meetings were nearby so for me location was excellent. I recommend this hotel to everyone.
126,Trend Excellent,Ohk.. So first of all.. The oyo people are idiots.. They don't even know the tariff rates of the hotel rooms..I reached at the hotel reception.. There was so rush like.. They are giving away the rooms for free.. Then i got to know that they all were having some tariff rates issue.. And same was with me.. I paid 1400 for the rum. Online.. But the hotel manager said the rrom tariff is 2200 and u have to call service center of oyo.. Then i called them.. After a huge conversation with 2 -3 person on call.. they said we will adjust the money after approval.. And call u back.. I was standing and waiting there like a begger.. They didn't called.. Then i did it by my own.. Nd asked the status.. They said the.. Money is already adjusted.. Means how service they are offering.. That they can't even call when the fault is from there side..The hotel staff was supporting..But for oyo i will give 0 ratings.. I appreciate that they adjusted money..

133,Trend Excellent,Amazing food chef is awesome can go again for food
134,The Daffodils Connaught Place,"This hotel is located at an excellent place, right in the outer circle of Connaught Place. The rooms are very old, showers stink. The bed linens are worn out. It's just a place to choose when you run out of options for a stay in CP. I think they can't help with the old construction, may be they are maintained that way. Feels like I'm somewhere in Viennese with old buildings around. I think one should experience this too. Go for it if you have com"
